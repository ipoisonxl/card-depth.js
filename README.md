# card-depth.js
Add cards with depth. Material design accurate. 

# How to get started
Simply add card-depth.js to your code directory and import it to your HTML.

# How to use
1. Find the element you want to make into a card. In this example, we'll use a div tag with some content in it.
```
<div>
  <p>I am content!</p>
</div>
```
2. Add "card" to the class name.
```
<div class="card">
  <p>I am content!</p>
</div>
```
3. Add your desired height effects. (consult the reference to learn about these)
```
<div class="card" z-default='20' z-hover='50'>
  <p>I am content!</p>
</div>
```

4. By default, your card should now exist with a height of 100px and a margin of 25px. It will have a transition of .15s for shadows by default. Check the reference to learn how to turn them off.
